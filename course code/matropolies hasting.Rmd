## Random walk with normal likelihood, t prior

```{r}
# data are the percent change in total personnel from last year to this year for n=10 companies
# yi is percent change in persoonal in company i. yi|mu ~ N(mu, 1)
# prior on mu is t(location = 0, scale = 1, df = 1) also call calchy distri.

# Because this model is not conjugate, the posterior distribution is not in a standard form that we can easily sample. To obtain posterior samples, we will set up a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is this posterior distribution.

# Recall that the posterior distribution is p(μ∣y1,…,yn)∝exp[n(y_barμ−μ^2/2)]/1+μ^2 = g(mu)
